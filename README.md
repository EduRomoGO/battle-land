## Comments

I have set up initial life to 25 instead of requested 100, however I recommend you to set to it to an even lower value (initialHalth var inside Game.js), cause otherwise it can be tedious to finish a game.  

I have used useReducer as requested, but in this case it would have been ok just using useState cause the state neede is quite simple.
